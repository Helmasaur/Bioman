It was first used for a group called [*TeamToilettesBio*](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TeamToilettesBio). Now, the aim is to make it universal.\n\nLots of thanks to *discord.js* [community](https://discord.gg/bRCvFy9) for their great help. I also want to thank [*BelleChoucroute*](https://twitter.com/Clo_Stylinson) for the wise advice she gives me and the official plastic duck used for tests known under the name [*Horsengel*]((https://twitter.com/Horsengel).",
